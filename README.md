### 🔸 Employee Management System  
**🔹 Technologies:** PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap  

🔧 *Personal project developed around 2019 to practice PHP and database design, and to explore building a modular CRUD application without a full framework.* 

**📝 Description:**  
A simple internal system for managing employees. It includes:  
- **User authentication:** registration (`signup.php`), login (`login.php`), logout (`logout.php`) and password change (`change_password.php`).  
- **Employee CRUD:** listing and managing employees (`admin_list.php`), backed by the SQL schema in `employees.sql`.  
- **Profile management:** personal profile page (`my_profile.php`).  
- **Employee details modules:** separate pages for “Education” (`education.php`) and “Experience” (`experience.php`).  
- **Role-based access control:** basic permission checks in the admin area (`admin/` folder).  
- **Project structure & assets:**  
  - Shared includes in `inc/` (config, header/footer templates)  
  - Custom JavaScript (`script.js`) for client‑side interactions  
  - CSS styles in `css/`, icon sets in `icons/`, and other images in `img/`.  
  - Built with procedural PHP (no framework) and Bootstrap for responsive UI.
